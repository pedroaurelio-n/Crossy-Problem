Originally this was a job test that I had to do in 1 week. Didn't get hired but I thought this turned out pretty good.

It uses procedural level generation based on terrain scriptable objects that contain prefab tiles. Tiles are hand-made according to the default template and can be placed inside the scriptable objects. Each object has some number of tile prefabs and can be generated randomly within also random intervals from 2-5 tiles, or can be generated sequentially according to placement order.
