# Crossy Problem

Crossy Problem is a Crossy Road clone (3D infinite runner game) for android devices and web applications where you control a person trying to proceed forward on the level while avoid cars and crossing rivers. The farther the player reach, higher the score. The main objective is trying to get the highest score possible. The game level is composed by chunks that are randomly chosen during gameplay to be part of the level.

Main gameplay code was originally made in 7 days back in December 2021 as an coding test for a Unity Developer job.
